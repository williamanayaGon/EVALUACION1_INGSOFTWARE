# Work Calendars

A work calendar application for each country for a multinational company. A RESTful Web API is implemented in Spring Boot using the Onion architecture.

## Project Structure

### Folders

The project is divided into several layers, each responsible for a specific set of functionalities. The main layers are:

- **`api`**: Presentation layer that exposes services via a RESTful API.
- **`application`**: Application logic layer that handles business logic.
- **`domain`**: Domain layer containing entities and domain logic.
- **`infrastructure`**: Infrastructure layer that handles database interaction and external services.

## Architecture

The project follows the principles of hexagonal architecture, which allows for a clear separation of concerns and easier code maintenance. Each layer interacts with the next layer according to its responsibility, minimizing coupling between them.

## Dependencies

- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building Spring-based applications.
- **Lombok**: Library that helps reduce boilerplate code (e.g., getters, setters, constructors).
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database used for persistence.
- **Spring Data JPA**: Provides functionality to interact with the database using JPA (Java Persistence API).
